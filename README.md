This project involves Named Entity Recognition (NER) for text extraction from tourism datasets. By assembling data from online articles, manual labeling, 
and data cleaning, this research focuses on model comparison using LSTM and CNN to improve the accuracy of entity recognition in tourism information, 
enabling deeper analysis for better understanding and use of the data.
